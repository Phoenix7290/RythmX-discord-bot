Simple music discord bot to play with some friends.
Also, my first project with Python.

This code was heavily based on the Youtube code MasterReach1 , where I express my thanks!

The bot has 4 commands: 

/play **url-here**
plays the music. For now, only works for Youtubr, however I plan to add Spotify and custom URLs.

/pause
Pauses it.

/resume
Resume the music.

/stop
Stops the bot entirely.
